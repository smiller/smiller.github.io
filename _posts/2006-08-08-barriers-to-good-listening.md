… but, when it isn’t a question of a pack of Spartan hounds tearing a bear to shreds, poor listening skills are more a problem than a theatrical entertainment.

I found <a href='http://www.sklatch.net/thoughtlets/listen.html' target='_blank'>this post</a> that chronicles eight common barriers to good listening and suggestions to get past them quite interesting. I will not, like Dante in the _Purgatorio_, go through them all and explain which ones I am particularly prey to, but I know all too well that I’m not in cleared-to-throw-stones territory.
