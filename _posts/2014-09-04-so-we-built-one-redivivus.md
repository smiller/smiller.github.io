The earlier entries here are the still-relevant ones from my old tech blog <a href='http://seanr.ca/' target='_blank'>“… So we built one”</a>, leaving out specific points and fixes around (say) rails 2.1 and rspec 1.1.4.

Some of my RubyFringe notes seem quaintly remote (we got a preview of the upcoming git feature of creating gists), but much of it is about underlying ways of thinking and still worth pondering.  Luke Francl’s remarks on testing being over-rated (not in any way bad, but the most complete set of tests imaginable doesn’t prove that your app doesn’t suck in the way that sitting and watching a user interacting with it might) remain topical and contested to this day.

There will be new content going forward.
